# 17 unprofessional work habits that make your boss and coworkers hate you

Do your coworkers or boss show signs that they secretly hate you?
If you answered "yes," then sure, it could be that they're generally disagreeable people. Or it could be you.
You may not realize it, but you could be engaging in workplace habits that make you look unprofessional.
While many of these habits violate the basic rules of common decency and respect, sometimes you need a reminder of how to behave at work. And since your office-mates aren't speaking up, we decided to chime in on their behalf.

## Bragging

> When we're proud of an accomplishment or about something good that happens to us, it's natural to want to share the news with others.

Says Rosalinda Oropeza Randall, an etiquette and civility expert and author of "Don't Burp in the Boardroom."
But sharing can easily become bragging, and she says there are a few key indicators that this is happening:

* If you go on and on, telling everyone and anyone who walks by.
* If you speak of it in a loud tone so that even the window washer can hear it through the thick glass.
* If you use a tone of superiority.
* If you feel the need to put down others and point out their failures.
* If you fail to say "thank you" when you are congratulated.
* If you start embellishing the story.
"When in doubt, try a little humility" Randall suggests.
